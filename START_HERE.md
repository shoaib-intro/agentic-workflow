## âš¡ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment (2 minutes)

Make sure your `.env` file has:

```env
DT_ENVIRONMENT=https://fcy32356.live.dynatrace.com
DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN=your_token_here

## ðŸ§ª Before Running - Test First

### Test MCP Tools Work:

```bash
python test_mcp_tools.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
âœ… Success! GetEnvironmentInfoTool
âœ… Success! ListProblemsTool
âœ… Success! ListVulnerabilitiesTool
```

If all tests pass, you're ready to run the full system!
