# Workshop Presentation Guide

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 40 minutes presentation + 30 minutes discussion  
**Objective:** Demonstrate a multi-agent system leveraging Dynatrace MCP Server for comprehensive observability analysis

## 📋 Presentation Structure (40 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

#### Slide 1: Problem Statement
**Key Points:**
- Application owners need to understand their observability data
- Dynatrace provides rich data but can be overwhelming
- Need actionable insights, not just raw data
- Goal: Bridge the gap between data and decisions

**Talking Points:**
```
"Imagine you're an application owner being onboarded to Dynatrace. 
You have access to problems, vulnerabilities, logs, metrics, and traces. 
But how do you make sense of it all? How do you know what to focus on?

That's the problem we're solving today with an intelligent multi-agent system."
```

#### Slide 2: Solution Overview
**Key Points:**
- Multi-agent AI system
- Specialized agents for different domains
- Hierarchical architecture
- Automated analysis and reporting

**Demo:** Show the architecture diagram from README.md

---

### Part 2: Architecture Deep Dive (10 minutes)

#### Slide 3: Hierarchical Agent Architecture
**Key Points:**
- Why hierarchical? (Specialization + Synthesis)
- Agent roles and responsibilities
- Sequential workflow with context propagation

**Visual:** Show the agent hierarchy diagram

**Talking Points:**
```
"We chose a hierarchical architecture for three reasons:

1. SPECIALIZATION: Each agent is an expert in their domain
   - Problem Analyst knows incident management
   - Security Analyst knows vulnerability assessment
   - Log Analyst knows debugging patterns

2. SYNTHESIS: The master agent combines insights
   - Correlates findings across domains
   - Provides holistic view
   - Generates actionable recommendations

3. CONTEXT FLOW: Agents build on each other
   - Log Analyst uses problems as context
   - Synthesizer uses all findings
   - No redundant work"
```

#### Slide 4: Agent Specifications

**For Each Agent, Explain:**

**Problem Analyst Agent:**
- Identifies open problems
- Assesses severity and impact
- Provides root cause when available
- Demo: Show GetProblemsTool code

**Security Analyst Agent:**
- Identifies vulnerabilities
- Assesses risk levels
- Tracks CVEs
- Demo: Show GetSecurityProblemsTool code

**Log Analyst Agent:**
- Analyzes error logs
- Correlates with problems
- Identifies patterns
- Demo: Show ExecuteDQLTool code

**Insights Synthesizer Agent:**
- Master orchestrator
- Synthesizes all findings
- Provides recommendations
- No tools (pure synthesis)

**Onboarding Guide Agent:**
- Educational content
- Best practices
- Practical examples
- Helps new users

#### Slide 5: Tool Integration
**Key Points:**
- Custom CrewAI tools
- Dynatrace API integration
- DQL query execution
- Error handling and formatting

**Demo:** Show `dynatrace_mcp_tools.py` structure

---

### Part 3: Live Demonstration (15 minutes)

#### Demo 1: System Setup (3 minutes)
```bash
# Show the project structure
tree /F

# Show environment configuration
cat .env.example

# Explain required credentials
```

**Talking Points:**
```
"Setting up is straightforward:
1. Install Python dependencies
2. Configure Dynatrace credentials
3. Add OpenAI API key
4. Run the system"
```

#### Demo 2: Running the Analysis (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Start the system**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Narrate as it runs:**
```
"Watch as the system:
1. Validates configuration
2. Initializes all 5 agents
3. Defines their tasks
4. Creates the crew

Now the agents start working sequentially..."
```

**Step 2: Show agent execution**
```
"First, the Problem Analyst queries Dynatrace for open problems.
It's using the GetProblemsTool to fetch data from the last 24 hours.

Next, the Security Analyst identifies vulnerabilities.
It's looking for CVEs and security risks from the last 7 days.

Now the Log Analyst correlates logs with the findings.
It's using DQL queries to fetch relevant error logs.

The Synthesizer is combining all findings into a comprehensive report.
It's correlating problems, vulnerabilities, and logs.

Finally, the Onboarding Guide creates educational content.
It's using real examples from this analysis."
```

**Step 3: Show the results**
```bash
# Display the generated report
cat reports/observability_report_*.md
```

#### Demo 3: Report Walkthrough (2 minutes)

**Highlight:**
- Executive summary
- Critical issues section
- Detailed analysis with evidence
- Actionable recommendations
- Onboarding guidance

---

### Part 4: Use Case Deep Dive (5 minutes)

#### Slide 6: Use Case - Find Open Problems & Vulnerabilities

**Scenario:**
```
"An application owner asks: 'What's wrong with my application?'

Traditional approach:
- Log into Dynatrace
- Check problems manually
- Check security separately
- Search logs individually
- Try to correlate everything
- Takes hours

Our approach:
- Run: python main.py
- Wait 3 minutes
- Get comprehensive report
- Everything correlated
- Prioritized recommendations"
```

**Show Real Output:**
- Problem identified: "High error rate on checkout service"
- Vulnerability found: "Critical CVE in payment library"
- Logs show: "Database connection timeout errors"
- Correlation: "Payment failures causing checkout errors"
- Recommendation: "1. Patch CVE immediately, 2. Scale database, 3. Add retry logic"

#### Slide 7: Value Proposition

**For Application Owners:**
- Understand what data is available
- Get actionable insights immediately
- Learn how to use Dynatrace effectively
- Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

**For SRE Teams:**
- Automated triage
- Consistent analysis
- Knowledge sharing
- Scale expertise

**For Organizations:**
- Faster incident response
- Better security posture
- Improved observability adoption
- Cost savings (reduced manual work)

- Tool integration
- Sequential and hierarchical workflows

**Code Example:**
```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Problem Analyst",
    goal="Identify and analyze problems",
    backstory="Expert SRE...",
    tools=[GetProblemsTool()],
    llm=create_llm()
)
```

#### Slide 9: Why Dynatrace MCP Server?

**Advantages:**
- Unified API access
- DQL query execution
- Real-time data
- Comprehensive observability
- Production-grade monitoring

**Integration:**
```python

vulnerabilities = client.get_security_problems("now-7d")
logs = client.execute_dql("fetch logs | filter status == 'ERROR'")
```

#### Slide 10: Cost Considerations

**Dynatrace Costs:**
- Grail queries: ~1-5 GB per analysis
- Cost: ~$0.0035-$0.0175 per analysis
- Budget tracking built-in
- Configurable limits

**OpenAI Costs:**
- GPT-4o-mini: Cost-efficient
- ~10,000-50,000 tokens per analysis
- Cost: ~$0.01 per analysis

## 🎤 Presentation Tips

### Engagement Strategies

1. **Start with a story:** "Imagine you're on-call at 3 AM..."
2. **Use analogies:** "Think of agents like a team of specialists..."
3. **Ask questions:** "How would you approach this problem?"
4. **Show, don't just tell:** Live demos are powerful
5. **Relate to audience:** "Have you ever struggled with..."

### Handling Questions

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "Why not use a single powerful agent?"**
A: "Specialization improves quality. Each agent has focused expertise and tools. The synthesizer combines insights that individual agents might miss."

**Q: "What if Dynatrace API is slow?"**
A: "We have timeout handling and can adjust query scopes. We also track Grail budget to prevent runaway costs."

**Q: "Can this replace human analysts?"**
A: "No, it augments them. It handles routine triage and provides starting points. Humans make final decisions and handle complex scenarios."

**Q: "How do you handle false positives?"**
A: "The synthesis agent correlates multiple data sources, which reduces false positives. We also provide evidence for each finding so humans can verify."

**Q: "What about privacy and security?"**
A: "All data stays in your environment. We use read-only API tokens. Reports can be sanitized before sharing."
